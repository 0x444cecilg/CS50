README file for BCDN Website:

Youtube link for final project: https://youtu.be/MZGucSIpEIE

1. This website is a blockchain and cryptocurrency information collective.
   I built it using programming languagues Python, SQL, & Javascript; mark-up languages
   HTML & CSS. I used Flask as a web framework along with it's language Jinja to tie each element together.

2. I created my website in the CS50 IDE and it can be compiled and interacted with by accessing the BCDN
   folder and entering the command line prompt: flask run. The BCDN folder includes a templates folder,
   a static folder, the app.py file, a helpers.py file, this README file, the DESIGN document, & the user database.
   The static folder includes 2 folders, css which includes the stylesheet, & js which includes the javascript, app.js
   & particles.js. The templates folder includes the 11 html templates: base, blockchain, cryptocurrency, defi, index,
   login, logout, nfts, password, register, & subscribe.

3. When the command line prompt flask run is imput by the user, a link is provided in the terminal window of the ide.
   Click the link given which will enable you to open the website in a new tab. Upon opening the website the user will
   encounter the login screen. The user is prompted for their credentials in order to access the sites materials. If
   the user has not created a username and password, one can be created by accessing the register link located in the
   navbar at the top of the site. Upon clicking the register link the user will be greeted with the register form
   prompting the user for a username, password and password confirmation. All fields are required in order to register.
   Upon registration the user will be redirected to the login screen where they can imput their username and password.

4. Once the username and password are entered the user is allowed access to all areas of the website. The user will
   first be directed to the home page and confronted with a link to Bitcoin's whitepaper, and a brief intro video
   on blockchain technology. From this page the user is able to make a couple of different choices. By way of the
   navbar located at the top of the website, a user can logout, chancge their password, subscribe to a newsletter,
   or access 4 informational pages on blockchain, cryptocurrency, decentralized finance, or non-fungible tokens by
   way of a drop down menu.

5. The logout link returns the user to the login screen when clicked. The change password link allows the user to change
   their password. The subscribe link directs the user to a new page with a form prompting for first name last name
   & email. When the user enters their credentials the user and I the creator recieve email notification of the new
   subscription, and the user is directed to a thank you screen from where they can access any of the other pages.
   When the dropdown link is clicked the user can access the various information on blockchain, cryptocurrency,
   decentralized finance, & non-fungible tokens, with small introductory paragraphs of text for the beginner, and links
   to take the user to more in depth content.
